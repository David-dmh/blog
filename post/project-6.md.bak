- Sourcing deals for rental property investing can be a challenging 
process. Not only does extensive searching need to be done but deal 
analysis needs must be thorough in order to determine whether a 
property can be a deal. This app serves as a tool which queries a 
real estate listing site and loads data into a data warehouse. 
Thereafter, the data is served along with user-defined master data in 
order to present useful functionalities for investors such as summary 
market statistics, a geocoded plot of property locations, lead 
generator, and investment deal calculator. I used a realestate.com.au
Python [wrapper](https://github.com/tomquirk/realestate-com-au-api) 
designed by GitHub user Tom Quirk to assist with the source ETL 
process.
- High-level design and data flow:

- **Dashboard**:  
View Australian property market stats as according to 
listings on realestate.com.au and drill-down by state.

- **Map**:  
View current listings in data warehouse fact table. 
Hover over a listing to view the precise address.

- **Leads**:  
Based on user-defined master data, e.g. downpayment 
percent, loan interest rate, desired ROI, current fact 
data is displayed with a calculated column of whether 
the property would make sense as deal based on your 
numbers ('Buy' or 'Pass').

- **Calculator**:  
Quickly try out different scenarios based on your 
investment strategy. Take screenshots of your results.

- Down the line, I plan to expand this project to 
add more functionality and package it for public use.

Versions used:

- Python 3.10.4
- R 4.2.0
