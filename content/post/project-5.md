---

- Real estate investing requires extensive deal analysis involving listing data and other key market and finance metrics.
- Flask was used to design a static database API to be used as a backend framework for advanced deal analysis applications.
- CI/CD automation was achieved using Heroku CI and simple unit testing with *unittest* was done.
- Data was obtained from *realestate.com.au*, a publically available Australian property site.
- Naturally, the API would be extended by including additional data required for analysis and updating the data in batch / real-time.
- With this automation, property investors can have an end-to-end deal analysis application.
- Swagger was used for API documentation and the API is hosted [here](https://au-prop-api.herokuapp.com/). The Swagger documentation provides a query functionality for obtaining data.
