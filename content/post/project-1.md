title: "Project 1: Data Science Job Analysis"
---
- Data collection was performed by modifying a prebuilt scraper (credits to https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium) to my use case. 
- Using Selenium it was possible to extract job posting information regarding different data science related job titles in various countries. 
- Jupyter notebook was used for importing and cleaning the data. 
- Exploratory data analysis was then performed to get some interesting insights into job profiles.
