title: "Project 3: Video Game Sales"
---
- Based on my study of the textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning by James et.al, I aimed for this to be a fun project to do in order to apply concepts covered.
- My aim was to create a linear regression model in order to predict global sales of a given video game. 
- Data was availble for video game sales via Kaggle:  
[kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales). 
- Despite the resulting model having low predictive power if predictors directly related to the response were to be excluded, it was simply a fun exercise to familiarise myself with the linear regression model building workflow.
- R was used for this project, from data cleaning and manipulation to model design.
- An html notebook was created using 'knitr' for an easy read of the code and its outputs (GitHub repo link below).

Versions used:

- R version 4.0.2
