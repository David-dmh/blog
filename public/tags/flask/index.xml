      <description>Real estate investing requires extensive deal analysis involving listing data and other key market and finance metrics. Flask was used to design a static database API to be used as a backend framework for advanced deal analysis applications. CI/CD automation was achieved using Heroku CI and simple unit testing with unittest was done. Data was obtained from realestate.com.au, a publically available Australian property site. Naturally, the API would be extended by including additional data required for analysis and updating the data in batch / real-time.</description>
