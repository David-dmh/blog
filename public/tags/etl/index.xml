      <description>Sourcing deals for rental property investing can be a challenging process. Not only does extensive searching need to be done but deal analysis needs must be thorough in order to determine whether a property can be a deal. This app serves as a tool which queries a real estate listing site and loads data into a data warehouse. Thereafter, the data is served along with user-defined master data in order to present useful functionalities for investors such as summary market statistics, a geocoded plot of property locations, lead generator, and investment deal calculator.</description>
